# Gianluca Mazza - Professional CV

This repository contains my CV in LaTeX format with automatic building via GitHub Actions.

## Features

- Professional CV layout using LaTeX
- Automatic PDF generation on push to main branch

## Automatic Building

This CV is automatically built into a PDF using GitHub Actions:

- On every push to the main branch (when .tex files change)
- On pull request creation
- On new releases
- Manually through workflow dispatch
